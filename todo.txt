basic modelling and animation is perchance achievable



swarm and volume animation and rendering with 4D noise

you have to basically only use simple animation with simple transformations,
the problem is the keyframes, not interpolation, and if you manually have
to make those keyframes it's a disaster if it's not something simple,
because it turns into modelling basically, for which you actually just
want to use a dedicated software if it's anything moderately complex; and
if you are interpolating, then by definition you kind of cannot proceduraly
make that animation, you have to manually set the keyframes.....
